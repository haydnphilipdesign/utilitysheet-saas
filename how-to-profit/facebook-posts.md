## 🎯 Post 1: The Personal Story (Best for TC Groups)

**For groups where authenticity and personal connection matter**

---

My mom has been a transaction coordinator for years. Watching her work is like watching someone juggle chainsaws while on a conference call.

One task that *always* created unnecessary chaos? **Collecting utility info from sellers.**

You know the drill:
- "Who's your electric company?" → "The electric company" 😅
- Half-filled forms sent via text
- Phone tag for days
- Missing info discovered 2 days before closing

I'm a web developer, and I've spent years building tools around her workflow. Finally turned one of them into something anyone can use:

**UtilitySheet.com** — Send sellers a simple form, get a clean, professional utility info sheet back. No chasing. No spreadsheets. No fire drills.

It's free to start — just wanted to share in case anyone else is tired of this particular chaos. 🙌

## 🎯 Post 2: The Pain Point Hook (Best for Real Estate Agent Groups)

**Short, punchy, problem-focused**

---

Quick question for agents:

How much time do you (or your TC) spend chasing sellers for utility provider info before closing?

Electric, water, gas, trash, HOA contacts... it shouldn't be complicated, but somehow it always turns into a game of telephone.

I built **UtilitySheet.com** specifically for this.

✅ Send sellers a simple link  
✅ They fill it out in minutes  
✅ You get a clean, shareable PDF  

No more back-and-forth. No more "I'll send it later."

## 🎯 Post 3: The "Why Does This Exist" Explainer (For TC-Specific Groups)

**More detailed, positions you as someone who understands the work**

Fellow TCs — I want to share something I built.

My mom runs PA Real Estate Support Services (transaction coordination). I've watched her handle hundreds of closings, and there's one task that's *way more painful than it needs to be*:

**Getting utility provider info from sellers.**

It sounds simple. It never is.

Sellers don't remember provider names. They say "the gas company." They promise to send it later. You follow up 3 times. Meanwhile, the deal is moving and the buyer needs this info.

I'm a developer, and I've been building tools for her workflow for a while. This one finally became something worth sharing:

**UtilitySheet.com**

→ Send sellers a guided form (takes them 5 min)  
→ Get a clean, branded utility sheet back  
→ Share it with agents, buyers, title — whoever needs it  

No databases to maintain. No crazy setup. Just solves the problem.

It's free to start. Would love feedback from anyone who tries it! 🙏

## 🎯 Post 4: The Quick Win (Shortest Version)

**For when you want minimal text**

---

## 🎯 Post 5: The Value Prop Focus (For Teams/Brokerages)

**Emphasizes consistency and professionalism**

---

If you manage transactions for a team or brokerage, here's something small that might clean up your workflow:

**Utility info collection.**

Every closing needs it. Every seller handles it differently. The result is usually a mix of texts, emails, and "I'll get it to you" that creates follow-up work right before closing.

**UtilitySheet.com** standardizes this:

🏠 Create a request for any property  
📧 Seller gets a guided form (takes 5 min)  
📄 You get a clean, branded PDF with all the info  

It's consistent every time. Looks professional. No chasing.

Free tier available — built this specifically for transaction coordinators and realized it might help others too.

## 🎯 Post 6: The Question Opener (Engagement-Focused)

**Gets people commenting, then you can share the solution**

---

TCs and agents — quick poll:

What's your current system for getting utility provider info from sellers?

A) Email/text and hope they respond  
B) A form that mostly works  
C) Call them directly  
D) Pray 🙏  
E) What's utility info? (lucky you)

Just curious because I built a tool specifically for this and wondering how people are handling it now...

## 🎯 Post 7: The "Launch Announcement" Style

**More formal, good for announcements**

---

🚀 **Soft Launch: UtilitySheet.com**

Hey everyone! Wanted to share something I've been working on.

I built **UtilitySheet.com** — a simple tool to collect and organize utility provider info for real estate transactions.

**The problem it solves:**
Collecting electric, water, gas, trash, internet, and HOA info from sellers is always messier than it should be. Lots of back-and-forth, inconsistent formats, and last-minute scrambles.

**How it works:**
1. Create a request for a property
2. Send the seller a link
3. They fill out a guided form (takes minutes)
4. You get a clean, professional utility sheet (PDF or web)

I built this because my mom runs a TC business and I saw how much unnecessary friction this task creates. Decided to turn it into something any agent or TC can use.

**Free tier available** — would love any feedback from this community!
