UtilitySheet.com — Why I built it (and why my mom’s business is the reason it exists)

UtilitySheet.com didn’t start as a startup idea. It started as me watching my mom do the same critical, high-friction work over and over—work that has to be correct because it impacts real closings, real deadlines, and real people.

Who my mom is and what her business actually does

My mom (Debbie / Deborah O’Brien) runs PA Real Estate Support Services, LLC, a transaction coordination business. If you’ve never worked with a TC before, the simplest way to describe it is:

She’s the operational backbone of a real estate transaction.

Agents are juggling listings, clients, showings, negotiations, and constant communication. The TC’s job is to make sure the transaction itself stays on rails:

documents are collected, accurate, and signed

deadlines are met

parties stay aligned (agent, seller/buyer, lender, title, inspectors, HOA, etc.)

nothing “small” gets missed (because small things turn into big delays)

That’s the nature of her work: high volume, high responsibility, and lots of details that aren’t glamorous but absolutely matter.

The reality of the workflow (and why “utility info” is sneakily painful)

One of the recurring tasks in a home sale is collecting and passing along utility provider information—electric, water, sewer, trash, gas/propane/heating oil, internet/cable, HOA contacts, and more.

On paper, this sounds simple:

“Just tell us who the providers are.”

In reality, it’s almost always messy:

Sellers don’t remember exact provider names.

They use nicknames (“the gas company”) or outdated names.

Some homes have propane and electric, or heating oil and a separate service provider.

Phone numbers and account instructions are rarely handy.

The request comes in the middle of a hundred other things happening.

Everyone handles it differently: text messages, emails, screenshots, half-filled PDFs, or “I’ll send it later” (and later becomes a fire drill).

And the killer part: this information is needed because the transaction is moving. So it creates a ton of back-and-forth—exactly the kind of time sink that slows closings and frustrates everyone.

What I do for her (and how that turned into product development)

I’m a web designer/dev, and over time I became the person building the tools around her workflow—because I could see where the friction lived.

My development work for her has included things like:

Custom intake forms to collect info consistently (instead of a free-for-all over email/text)

Structured checklists and process flows that match how TCs actually work

Better templates for client communication (fewer follow-ups, clearer requests)

Automation ideas around repeated tasks (the “same questions, every transaction” problem)

PDF outputs that look professional and are easy to share with agents/clients/title/etc.

Reducing data entry and “copy/paste across 5 systems” work

And because she lives inside tools like Outlook/email, DocuSign, Dotloop, KW Command, MLS-related workflows, and all the constant coordination… I wasn’t building in a vacuum. I was building against reality.

The more I helped, the more obvious it became:
utility-provider collection is a perfect example of a task that should be fast, standardized, and shareable—but usually isn’t.

The core insight that became UtilitySheet

Most solutions in real estate software fail because they assume people will do extra setup:

build a database

configure regions

maintain provider lists

train everyone

enforce compliance

That’s not how real transactions work. People are busy, and deals move whether your software is ready or not.

So UtilitySheet was designed around a different principle:

The seller should be able to complete this in minutes with minimal effort.
The agent/TC should get a clean, shareable result instantly.

Not “upload your bill.” Not “verify every provider.” Not “spend an hour configuring your county.”

Just:

collect the provider names (and phone numbers if needed)

structure it cleanly

make it easy to pass forward

make it repeatable across transactions

What UtilitySheet.com is (in plain language)

UtilitySheet.com is a lightweight, transaction-friendly way to collect utility provider information and output it in a clean, professional format that can travel with the deal.

It exists because this task:

happens constantly

is always slightly different

creates unnecessary back-and-forth

and doesn’t need to be as painful as it is

Why I’m posting this / who it’s for

I built UtilitySheet because I’ve had a front-row seat to transaction coordination: the pace, the pressure, the volume, and the fact that simple missing info can snowball into delays.

If you’re:

a transaction coordinator

an agent who’s tired of chasing sellers for utility info

a team that wants a more consistent closing workflow

…I built this for the exact problem you’ve probably already felt.

Short version (for a punchier post)

My mom runs a transaction coordination business (PA Real Estate Support Services, LLC). Watching her manage high-volume closings made one thing obvious: collecting and transferring utility provider info is way more chaotic than it should be—lots of back-and-forth, inconsistent formats, missing details, and last-minute scrambling.

I’m a web designer/dev, and I’ve been building tools around her workflow for a while (forms, templates, structured outputs, PDF generation, reducing repetitive admin). UtilitySheet.com came directly from that: a fast, standardized way to collect utility providers from sellers and generate a clean sheet that can move with the transaction.
